##  Changes 
HTML File Update: I replaced "Ernesto" with "Joel" in the HTML file.

JS File Modification: In the JS file, I renamed the variable "i" to "contar."

CSS File Alteration: I changed the background to red color in the CSS file.

New "yourname.js" File: I added a new file called "Joel.js" and included a function that displays "Goodbye" after 10 seconds.

Workspace Configuration Adjustments: I adjusted the workspace settings as follows:
I set the tab size to 4.
I changed the theme to a new one (e.g., "cat").

Document Formatting: I executed document formatting to apply the changes to each file.

## Opinion about the task
1. It wasn't particularly challenging, nor was it exceptionally easy.
2. The only challenge I faced was timing the "Goodbye" message to appear after 10 seconds, which I managed to resolve.
